- Our marketplace allows the plethora of child-care and baby-care items that are swiftly grown out of to find a new home. We do not want any items that can be tresured to end up in the landfill. Also, moms might be able to use the money they earn to support their kids and themself.
- We want to make sure that moms know all the resources available to them, whether it be local organizations or readings about health after childbirth.
