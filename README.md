# Our values 🫶
- We strive to create a safe space for all parents to be seen and embraced. In a world wehre they are expected to know it all, we wan't parents to know that it's okay to ask for help, and that they deserve it.
- Our marketplace allows the plethora of child-care and baby-care items that are swiftly grown out of to find a new home. We do not want any items that can be tresured to end up in the landfill. Also, parents might be able to use the money they earn to support their kids and families.
- We want to make sure that parents know all the resources available to them, whether it be local organizations or readings about health after childbirth.

# How we protect parents and their children 🫂
- Our platform only allows experts (gynecologist, dietitions, pediatricians and other health care workers) to answer the health related questions to protect against misinformation.
- Our platform utilizes elegant flower drawings to ensure profile pictures do not reveal babies' identities.

- the ability to create an account as either a parent or an expert (medical professionals).
- text-based posting and commenting
- posting listings for items on the marketplace
- inquiring about listings for items on the marketplace
